# Example Outputs

The `examples/` directory stores SVG plots generated by running the main script or the notebook.

- `actual_vs_predicted.svg`: Scatter plot comparing ground truth targets with Bayesian predictions.
- `predictive_uncertainty.svg`: Line plot of predictive mean with a shaded uncertainty band (±2 standard deviations).

These files are overwritten each time the pipeline runs, making it easy to compare results after changing settings.
